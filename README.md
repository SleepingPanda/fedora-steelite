# Fedora STEELITE

## Fedora Kinoite with:

- `Bitwarden` with biometrics and SSH-Agent support
- `libratbag` to get your Logitech peripherals working correctly
- `Steam`, `MangoHUD` and `Gamescope` for pretty obvious reasons
- `Visual Studio Code`, `Tabby` and `Docker` for devops and better integration with CLI tools
- `WinBoat` for running windows apps with a near seamless experience
- `LACT` for GPU metrics, fan control and overclocking

## TODO

- `NVIDIA` WIP

## NOTE

This is not meant for regular users in its current state. You would be better served by nstalling Fedora like a normal person! If you still want to make the jump for some reason, be sure to carefully examine build_files\build.sh before installing!
