# Fedora STEELITE

## Fedora Kinoite with:

- `Bitwarden` with biometrics and SSH-Agent support
- `libratbag` to get your Logitech peripherals working correctly
- `Steam`, `MangoHUD` and `Gamescope` for pretty obvious reasons
- `Visual Studio Ccode` for better integration with CLI tools

## TODO

- `NVIDIA`

## NOTE

This is not meant for regular users. If that's what you want, install Fedora like a normal person! Make sure to carefully examine the build file before installing!
